               <h3>Technology</h3>
               <p>I love the ever evolving technology that comes out and the way it makes a positive impact in our lives. I lived through the dial up days of old and get to appreciate the high speed internet of the present. The technological changes from flip phones to smart phones, from NES to the PS5, from manually rolling up your car windows to self-driving electric cars never cease to amaze me. I am truly in awe about the science of technology. I am also extremely grateful that I get to be working at HP and to be a part of innovation in bringing new technology to the people.</p>

            <h3>Gaming</h3>
            <p>"I grew up playing video games as early as the NES days with Super Mario and Duck Hunt. I am became a big fan of RPG's and loved the block of games from the 90's like Chrono Trigger, FF6, FF7, Final Fantasy Tactics and Xenogears, just to name a few. Fast forward to the present day, I have been enjoying turn-based strategy games like Civilization 6. One of my most enjoyed games has been an MMORPG called Final Fantasy 14. Gaming has always been a passion of mine because it does bring a story into life and sometimes, you get a glimpse of being a hero in that world."</p>

            <p>"Music is a universal language that speaks to the soul. I love music and have incredible admiration for the artists who are able to masterfully put art together in the form of sound that can take you to another place. I definitely have a deep and unending love to listen to the intricate notes and to hear the raw emotions and stories that the artists are trying to relay through music."</p>

I love going to the beach and listening to the rhythmic sounds of the ocean waves. I enjoy going on cruises and have been to the Carribeans and Mexico. I've also traveled to Vietnam and various parts of China. Traveling to Japan and other parts of Southeast Asia, Netherlands, Sweden and similar parts of Europe are definitely on my bucket list!"</p>
